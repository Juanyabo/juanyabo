## Hi there 👋 I'm Juan Gianella Blanco

I’m a Systems Engineer from Bolivia. I studied at the Universidad Privada de Santa Cruz de la Sierra (UPSA), where I defended my thesis on a 2D structural stability analysis software and graduated Summa Cum Laude. After completing my degree, I decided to follow one of my lifelong passions — video game development — and pursued a Master’s in Advanced Video Game Programming at U-Tad University in Spain.

My journey into tech started back in 2019, when I first opened this GitHub account and began diving into programming fundamentals, OOP, computer networks, advanced data structures, operating systems, databases, software engineering, web development, and AI. In 2023, I completed a front-end internship in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, where I was responsible for debugging and fixing UI issues in production codebases — an experience that strengthened my attention to detail and problem-solving mindset.

At U-Tad, I challenged myself to go from zero experience in game development to mastering C++, Unreal Engine, and Unity, while learning how to build both 2D and 3D game engines and develop fun, believable AI. I also joined the student team Zulo Interactive, where we developed [Lady Umbrella](https://github.com/Juanyabo/Lady-Umbrella). My main focus was on UI systems — implementing the in-game HUD and the first iteration of menus and their navigation for controller, keyboard, and mouse.

My passion is to develop software that has real meaning and purpose, something people can genuinely enjoy or find useful in their everyday lives.
